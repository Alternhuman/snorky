Snorky is a framework for building WebSocket servers based on common patterns.

Snorky runs on top of `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_ a fast, performant, asynchronous web server. Snorky is intended to run as a separated process, therefore being able to communicate with web applications written in any programming language or framework.
